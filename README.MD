# Periodic Table

A simple yet fully interactive periodic table fully written in pure CSS and Jquery. 

## Features
- Animated Atomic Models (WIP) - calculated based on atomic number and Bohr principles
- Clickable elements - select any element to view info crawled from Wikipedia

## Current Issues and Notes
- In order for each element's info to pop up, reload the page upon start. 
- There will be some elements that won't have info (for example caesium and Mercury), due to different UK and US spellings.
